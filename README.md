# A Rust Driver and CLI for accessing Blind Insight

Blind Insight is an end-to-end encrypted data store.
All included projects are Rust implementations for accessing and utilizing this data store.

## Projects

### [blind-proxy-rs](https://github.com/judgegrubb/blind-insight-rs/tree/main/blind-proxy-rs)

A Rust implementation of Blind Insight's Blind Proxyâ€”A CLI tool for utilizing the Blind Insight datastore. 

### [blind-wrapper-rs](https://github.com/judgegrubb/blind-insight-rs/tree/main/blind-wrapper-rs)

A Rust wrapper of Blind Insight's [OpenAPI Specification](https://docs.blindinsight.io/api-reference/), 
allowing Rust developers easy access to the full Blind Insight API suite.

## Future Project Ideas

- Simple plaintext interface for describing Blind Insight queries, similar to MongoDB Queryable Encryption's capabilities with Atlas Search
- Leakage analysis framework built around Blind Insight APIs
